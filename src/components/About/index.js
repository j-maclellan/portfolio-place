            <p>
                My name is John Maclellan, and thank you for visiting my Portfolio website! 
                Here I have a few of the projects I have worked on and contributed to. I am proud of the work I have done but as the big letters say,
                this is supposed to be about me, not my code. 

                I am 25 years old, and graduated from UTC with a degree in literature. Now before you start asking questions, I do believe my extensive experience reading Shakespeare does actual help me code better.
                For one, I know exactly where semi-colons and commas are supposed to go. Also, after reading ye Olde english, terms like "href" and "div" just seem natural to me. 
                But I would hate to come across as long winded, so I will just say thank you for checking out my page and I hope you like what you see!
